Last Minute Notes To Visit


Operating System is an interface between hardware and user 

What to expect 
1) Process scheduling :
    
      FIFO
   
      SJF
   
      Round Robin
3) Process Synchronization :
   
      Semaphore
4) Deadlocks And threads :
   
      Bankers algo
5) Memory Management :
   
      Paging
   
      Segmentation
   
      Fragmentation
   
      Virtual memory
   
      Page Replacement Algo
6) Disk Scheduling :
   
      SCAN
   
      CSCAN
   
      FCFS
7) UNIX Commands :
   
      ls, dir, cd, open system calls
8) File Management Security :
   
    seq, random, linked

### Operating System and its Function

1)Resource Management

2)Process Management(CPU Scheduling)

3)Storage Management(Hard Disk)

4)Memory Management (RAM)

5) Security and Privacy 

### Types of Operating Systems

1)BATCH OS- Jobs are stored in the main memory, the job is assigned to the CPU when the previous jobs are executed.

Advantages :

It is very difficult to guess or know the time required for any job to complete. Processors of the batch systems know how long the job would be when it is in the queue.

Multiple users can share the batch systems.

The idle time for the batch system is very less.

It is easy to manage large work repeatedly in batch systems.

Disadvantages :

The computer operators should be well known with batch systems.

Batch systems are hard to debug.

It is sometimes costly.

The other jobs will have to wait for an unknown time if any job fails.

2)MULTIPROGRAMMING OS-Non Primitive 

can be simply illustrated as more than one program is present in the main memory and any one of them can be kept in execution. This is basically used for better execution of resources.

Advantages :

Multi Programming increases the Throughput of the System.
It helps in reducing the response time.

Disadvantages :

There is not any facility for user interaction of system resources with the system.

3)MULTIPROCESSING OS-Primitive

is a type of Operating System in which more than one CPU is used for the execution of resources. It betters the throughput of the System.

Advantages

It increases the throughput of the system.

As it has several processors, so, if one processor fails, we can proceed with another processor.

Disadvantages

Due to the multiple CPU, it can be more complex and somehow difficult to understand.
